SYNOPSIS

    gist [-p|--private] [-n|--name <filename>]
    gist [-p|--private] [-a|--add-remote] <filename> [<filename> ...]

USAGE

    gist will upload files or snippets of code to http://gist.github.com/
    and output the Git URLs of the newly created gist mini-repository.

    If no file is specified, gist will read from stdin. (The --name option
    can then be used to specify the filename.)

    If user has GitHub authentication data entered into ~/.gitconfig (see
    AUTHENTICATION below), the post will be associated to his GitHub account.

EXAMPLES

	gist < file.txt
	gist file.txt file.pl file.conf
	ls | gist --private --name files.txt

    git config --global github.user your-github-username
    git config --global github.token your-github-token
