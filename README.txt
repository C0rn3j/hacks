Hey

HAVE I MENTIONED I WRITE A LOT OF SCRIPTS

Anyway, I'm trying to reduce ~/code to only "things worth carrying around",
since it is rather large by now, and ~/bin is sort-of "currently used scripts"
only, so here's a third repo for all the miscellaneous garbage.

Table of contents:

  Dead-projects/
    – things I gave up working on, realizing they went nowhere
  Hacks/
    – cool stuff that might or might not be useful
      (largely, scripts that were once necessary but not anymore)
  Snippets/
    – code I sometimes reuse

vim: ts=4:sw=4:et
