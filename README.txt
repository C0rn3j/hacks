Hey

HAVE I MENTIONED I WRITE A LOT OF SCRIPTS

Anyway, I'm trying to reduce ~/code to only "things worth carrying around",
since it is rather large by now, and ~/bin is sort-of "currently used scripts"
only, so here's a third repo for all the miscellaneous garbage.

---

Stuff:

  Dead-projects/
    – things I gave up working on, realizing they went nowhere
  Hacks/
    – cool stuff that might or might not be useful
  Obsolete/
    – once necessary but no longer useful scripts, most used only once
  Snippets/
    – code I sometimes reuse
  Useless/
    – useless stuff that wasn't really meant to be finished

vim: ts=4:sw=4:et
